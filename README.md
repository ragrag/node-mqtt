# Nodejs WS-MQTT
Live version at : http://node-wsmqtt.herokuapp.com
<br>

Install Node
<br>run <b>npm install</b>
<br> Run <b>node app.js</b> in terminal
<br> access on <b>http://localhost:3000</b>
<br>Edit /config/strings if you want to change server port, default is 3000

<br><br>
<h3>Note</h3>
when using the live heroku version browser might block some scripts (usually can enable from the shield icon in address bar).
This happens because heroku uses ssl by default which isn't supported by non-ssl ws-mqtt services
